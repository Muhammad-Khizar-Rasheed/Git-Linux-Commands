# Git-Linux-Commands

## git add:
Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.

## git branch:
This command is your general-purpose branch administration tool. It lets you create isolated development environments within a single repository.

## git checkout:
In addition to checking out old commits and old file revisions, git checkout is also the means to navigate existing branches. Combined with the basic Git commands, it’s a way to work on a particular line of development.

## git clean:
Removes untracked files from the working directory. This is the logical counterpart to git reset, which (typically) only operates on tracked files.

## git clone:
Creates a copy of an existing Git repository. Cloning is the most common way for developers to obtain a working copy of a central repository.

## git commit:
Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow for all Git users.

## git commit --amend:
Passing the --amend flag to git commit lets you amend the most recent commit. This is very useful when you forget to stage a file or omit important information from the commit message.

## git config:
A convenient way to set configuration options for your Git installation. You’ll typically only need to use this immediately after installing Git on a new development machine.

## git fetch:
Fetching downloads a branch from another repository, along with all of its associated commits and files. But, it doesn't try to integrate anything into your local repository. This gives you a chance to inspect changes before merging them with your project.

## git init:
Initializes a new Git repository. If you want to place a project under revision control, this is the first command you need to learn.

## git log:
Lets you explore the previous revisions of a project. It provides several formatting options for displaying committed snapshots.
